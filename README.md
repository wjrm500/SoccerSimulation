# Soccer Simulation

At its heart, the simulation is built on several layers of configuration and dynamic processes:

Configuration and Setup
The simulation is initialised with a suite of configuration settings that determine the size and structure of the simulated universe. This includes parameters such as the number of systems, leagues per system, clubs per league, and players per club. Time is managed by defining a start date and allowing the simulation to “time travel” through days or gameweeks, updating state as it progresses. Formations are predefined with both a personnel layout—for instance, a “4-4-2” or “3-5-2” arrangement—and a popularity weight that probabilistically influences which formation a club will adopt .

Detailed Player Development Model
Each player is created with an initial set of skill attributes across six key areas: offence, spark, technique, defence, authority, and fitness. These attributes are initially sampled from a normal distribution defined in the configuration and then centralised and rebalanced to ensure consistency across the player pool 
.

Players are assigned an age (with boundaries typically between 15 and 40) and a birth date derived relative to the simulation’s start date.
A “peakAge” and “peakRating” are then generated using bounded random values, which serve as the benchmarks for the player’s development. The simulation calculates a player’s current rating as a function of their distance from peak age; during the ascending (growth) phase, a player’s rating increases, and after reaching peak age, it declines. The rate of change is controlled by separate growth and decline parameters, which can be fine-tuned via configuration. For instance, the rating is computed using a formula that scales the peakRating by a “fulfilment” factor that decreases as the distance from peak age increases 
.
Moreover, the simulation includes a subtle “transition” mechanism where, as players age, certain skills (for example, a reduction in “spark”) can gradually shift to boost “authority” to represent the accrual of game intelligence over time 
.
Visualisation tools are embedded to produce plots of a player’s predicted ratings over time and radar charts that display the distribution of their skills, providing insight into the evolution of individual attributes 
.
Team Formation and Tactical Selection
Clubs are assigned a “favourite formation” chosen randomly from the available formations, weighted by their popularity. Each formation specifies the number of players required in each role. When selecting a matchday team, the simulation follows these steps:
It starts by copying the personnel requirements of the chosen formation and iterates until every slot is filled.
For each required position, every available player (subject to constraints like injury status) is evaluated. A “selectRating” is calculated for each candidate based on their positional rating, which is further adjusted for fatigue and recent form. An important modifier in this calculation is the home/away differential, which slightly boosts or reduces a player’s effective performance depending on the venue 
.
The player with the highest modified rating is selected for that position, and the process repeats until all positions are filled, resulting in a complete tactical lineup that aggregates into a team object with both offensive and defensive ratings derived from the selected players.
Match Simulation and Outcome Determination
During a match simulation, the teams selected by each club face off with several layers of probabilistic modelling:
Each team’s “potential” is computed as the difference between its aggregated offensive strength and the opposing team’s defensive strength.
This potential value is then used to index a Gaussian probability distribution (with specific mu and sigma values provided by configuration) to generate an expected number of goals. The application of home or away multipliers further adjusts these numbers to reflect situational advantages 
.
Once the goal tallies are determined for both teams, the match outcome (win, draw, or loss) is decided.
In parallel, individual player contributions are recorded. A dedicated reporting engine calculates detailed performance indices for each player by incorporating factors such as offensive and defensive contributions, goal and assist likelihoods (derived from both individual skills and positional factors), and adjustments for fatigue. This involves complex calculations that modulate a base rating with additional boosts or penalties based on the match events, ensuring that a player’s performance index accurately reflects their impact on the game 
.
League Progression and Statistical Updates
After each match, league tables are updated to reflect cumulative performance:
The system maintains a historical record of match outcomes, updating statistics like games played, wins, draws, losses, goals for and against, goal difference, and points on a gameweek basis.
When all clubs have completed a match in a given gameweek, the system creates a new gameweek entry by duplicating and then adjusting the previous week’s statistics based on the recent results. This mechanism ensures a smooth progression through the season while allowing for dynamic league standings 
.
Persistence, Visualisation, and Notification
Beyond simulation mechanics, the system serialises the universe’s state for persistence. The simulation data is stored using a combination of GridFS and a database, ensuring that state can be retrieved or analysed later. Additionally, when a simulation run is complete, the system can send email notifications to users, providing links to view detailed reports and visualisations, such as plots of league positions over time 
.

Additional Nuances and Easter Eggs
Finally, the simulation incorporates small but interesting nuances to mimic real-world quirks. For example, clubs with particular names receive special treatment—some clubs have their players’ peak ratings adjusted (either increased or decreased) to emulate historical reputations, adding an extra layer of realism and unpredictability to match outcomes.

In summary, the simulation achieves a sophisticated balance between individual player development and collective team performance by:

Employing detailed statistical models to drive player growth and decline based on age and experience,
Incorporating tactical formation logic that considers player condition (fatigue and form) to select optimal lineups,
Simulating matches using probabilistic models that translate team potential into realistic goal outcomes, and
Continuously updating league standings and player performance metrics across simulated gameweeks.
